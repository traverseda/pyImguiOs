Do you release this code under the AGPL so that everyone can use it but they
have to release what ever they use it for as open source?

 - [ ] I agree to release the code I've written in this submission under the
     [AGPL License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt)

Can I (Alex Davies) have a copy of it under the BSD license, so that I can sell companies a
license to build proprietary software on top of your contributions?

 - [ ] I also agree to grant Alex Davies permission to use and distribute the code
     I've written in this submission under the [zero-clause BSD
     license](https://opensource.org/licenses/0BSD).

Alternativly, you could let anyone sell proprietary software based on the code
you're submitting.
